Parsing and scanning (Context Free Grammar)

#Assignment:

Implement a recursive descendent parser. 
The representation of the parsing tree will be a table (using father and sibling relation)

<b> The assignment is divided in the following phases: </b>

<b> 1: Perform the parsing of an input sequence </b>

Input: - a context free grammar - an input sequence </br>
Output: the parsing tree corresponding to the input sequence or a message in case the sequence is not accepted. </br>
		( Remark: Verify if the parsing method can be applied )

<b> 2: Performs the parsing for a program written in your mini-language </b>

Input: PIF + mini-language grammar </br>
Output: parsing tree corresponding to the program or a message for errors (error diagnose where it is the case) </br>
