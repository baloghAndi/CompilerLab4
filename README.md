Regular grammars and finite automata

#Assignment:

Write a program that: </br>
1. Reads a grammar from keyboard and from file </br>
2. Displays the elements of a grammar, using a menu: set of non-terminals, set of terminals, set of productions, the productions of a given non-terminal symbol.  </br>
3. Verifies if the grammar is regular </br>
4. Reads the elements of a FA (Finite Automaton) from keyboard and from file </br>
5. Displays the elements of a finite automata, using a menu: the set of states, the alphabet, all the transitions, the set of final state.  </br>
6. Given a regular grammar constructs the corresponding finite automaton. </br>
7. Given a finite automaton constructs the corresponding regular grammar.  </br>
